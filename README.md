# jsioc
Since google code is shutting down I'm migrating this very old (2007) project to github,
originally from code.google.com/p/jsioc

Original README
===============
This is a 15 minute work that I've done some time ago 
(more exactly here: http://mykenta.blogspot.com/2007/09/kentaioc-js-ioc-library-english-version.html) 
to show how to use an inversion of control container in JavaScript, and how easy is to write one. 
JS IoC is a container that permit to do what is called `Dependancy Injection by Hand` 
written in few lines of JavaScript. 

It supports lazy loading and Initialization by constructor or by setter.
